/**
 * This file implements a "UDP ping server".
 *
 * It basically waits for datagrams to arrive, and for each one received, it responds to the original sender
 * with another datagram that has the same payload as the original datagram. The server must reply to 3
 * datagrams and then quit.
 *
 * Test with:
 *
 * $ netcat -u 127.0.0.1 8080
 * ping
 * ping
 * pong
 * pong
 *
 * (assuming that this program listens at localhost port 8080)
